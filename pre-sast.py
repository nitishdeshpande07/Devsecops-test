# Creation of automated GitHub Public Repository / Fetch the Public Repository Details
# But as this is a Jenkins based CI/CD pipeline provisioning hence now it would be 
# a further step : NO LINK-UP YET.

# A Python based Module that would parse the current user's project directory make 
# and would make sure and identify that it's a Node based Application Project. 
# Indentify all the components that it has and then get's ready for further Implementation
# Also create the entire project's Docker Image Locally.
# Target Project Type : Node.js based Sample Application with an Allied DockerFile. 
# This module script should also be able to extract the exact full directory path
# allied to this actual project so as to supply it to various tool's docker images for 
# further operations and etc .. 
# As a response the tool should also be returning the final msg that " Project Setup Done .  Ready to Be Staged "
